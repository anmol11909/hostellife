		<div class="quality"><h2>Adaptability</h2>
		<p>Living in a hostel means living with people from different backgrounds and cultures.

		<div class="quality"><h2>Responsibility</h2>

		<div class="quality"><h2>Teamwork</h2>
		<p>Living in a hostel also teaches a student how to work in a team. They learn how to collaborate with others and how to communicate effectively. They also learn how to compromise and how to resolve conflicts. These skills are crucial for success in any field.</p></div>

		<div class="quality"><h2>Time Management</h2>
		<p>Living in a hostel requires students to manage their time efficiently. They have to balance their academic responsibilities with their social life and other activities. This helps them develop good time management skills, which are essential for success in any field.</p></div>

		<div class="quality"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
